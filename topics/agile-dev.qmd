# Agile Development

<div id="main-content" class="wiki-content">
<p>Agile development is essentially a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>philosophy</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>developed in response to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>bureaucratic</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>software development processes.</p>
<p>It is an approach that focuses on the realities of software:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>over<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>processes and tools</strong></li>
<li><strong>Working software</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>over<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>comprehensive documentation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Customer collaboration</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>over<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>contract negotiation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Responding to change</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>over<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>following a plan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, it is based on a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>mistrust</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>of machines, plans, contracts, documents, etc.</p>
<p>The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Agile Manifesto</strong>&nbsp; was written in 2001 after a number of lighter and more flexible approaches were developed in the 1990s</p>
<ul>
<li>SCRUM</li>
<li>XP (Extreme Program)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also a collection of<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>methods and tools</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>User stories</li>
<li>Scrum meetings</li>
<li>Sprints</li>
<li>Task weighting with cards</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agile is also<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>counter-cultural</strong>, like many of the software movements that attended the rise of the web&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are the 12 Principles of Agile SD:</p>
<ol>
<li>Customer satisfaction by<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>early and continuous delivery</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>of valuable software. &rarr; The "early and often" of open source development.</li>
<li><strong>Welcome changing requirements</strong>, even in<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>late</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>development.</li>
<li>Deliver working software<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>frequently</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(weeks rather than months)</li>
<li>Close,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>daily</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>cooperation between business people and developers</li>
<li>Projects are built around<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>motivated individuals</strong>, who should be<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>trusted</strong></li>
<li><strong>Face-to-face</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)</li>
<li><strong>Working software</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is the primary measure of progress</li>
<li><strong>Sustainable</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>development, able to maintain a constant pace</li>
<li><strong>Continuous</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>attention to technical excellence and good design</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>&mdash;the art of maximizing the amount of work not done&mdash;is essential</li>
<li>Best<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="external-link" title="Agile Architecture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_Architecture">architectures</a>, requirements, and designs emerge from<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>self-organizing</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>teams</li>
<li>Regularly,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>the team reflects</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, it's all about<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>giving teams the freedom and trust</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to creatively respond to client needs and change.</p>
<p>As an aside, it's worth noting the effect of the Web on these developments</p>
<ul>
<li>Agile was spurred by the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>affordances of the Web</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>open source software</strong></li>
<li>And for teams to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>organize organically</strong>,&nbsp;without the oversight of governmental bodies or corporations</li>
<li>Influenced by the success of Open Source tools like<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Linux</strong></li>
<li>Consistent with<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Git</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>as a tool for organically organizing software development</li>
</ul>
