# Project Management

<p><strong>Some basic facts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Project management is an<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>established field</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>that is used for many activities.
<ul>
<li>It is a profession in which you can be<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>certified</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>as a&nbsp; CPM.</li>
<li>It is a field with an established and large<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>body of knowledge</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&ndash; PMBOK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Broadly speaking, it refers to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>a class of rational methods and protocols for organizing the labor of complex activities in order to achieve specific outcomes on time and on budget</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Think<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>NASA's</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>space program in the 1960s.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Its history dates to the early 20th century but becomes highly developed in the 1950s and 60s.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is closely associated with<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>US military</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>operations, e.g. Gantt Charts and PERT.</li>
<li>It was later adapted to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>software development</strong>, due to the complexity and importances of of this kind of work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Software is also<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>mission critical</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From the beginning, it has been used to support<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>critical operations</strong>: weapons systems, air traffic control, financial systems, health care, etc.</li>
<li>Only recently are we seeing the effects of software design &ndash; in the form of data products &ndash; fail on the basis of bias and other flaws that lead to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>social harm</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the 1960s</strong>, the US Department of Defenses study of software problems found that:</p>
<ul class="uva-lessons-ul">
<li>47% of software delivered could not be used, as it usually didn&rsquo;t meet requirements</li>
<li>29% of funded software was never delivered, as it was usually canceled due to cost/schedule overruns</li>
<li>19% of software was useful after extensive rework, and it usually cost 36 times more to fix problems after release</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>software engineering was developed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But Software development is hard</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware and software are inherently<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>complex</strong>.</li>
<li>Code is imperfect and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>error-prone</strong>.</li>
<li>Code is always<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>an interpretation of specifications</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>that are always<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>underspecified</strong>. &rarr; DEBUGGING THE SPEC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Underspecified</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in two senses:</p>
<ul>
<li>The inherent<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>inadequacy of language</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to represent reality.
<ul>
<li>"The map is not the terrain"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fact that<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>people don't know what they want</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>even when they say they do.
<ul>
<li>That is, reality itself changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The slipperiness of writing code that achieves our goals is<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>the subject of humor</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>paradigms of the software development</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>life cycle</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(SDLC) have been introduced over the years to address these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Waterfall</li>
<li>Spiral</li>
<li>Etc. &rarr; See<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="external-link" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/index.htm">Tutorialspoint on SDLC.</a></li>

<p><strong>The Waterfall Model</strong></p>

![Waterfall Methodology](../media/pm-waterfall.jpg)

[Source](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FJ4rlfMcDfc/V8mDTJfcDQI/AAAAAAAAA4s/f1dd7JC9-QsBh-67gdIDpq5ThubrTcVywCK4B/s1600/maxresdefault.jpg)

<p>What they all have in is a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>faith in the power of planning and engineering</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to achieve results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning as the ability to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>predict accurately how things will unfold</strong>
<ul>
<li>and have people understand and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>follow rules</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Engineering as the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>operationalization</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>of labor processes
<ul>
<li>The ability to treat<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>human behavior</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>as a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>tractable variable</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>the logic of the machine applied to the the organization of labor.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These assumptions are reflected in the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>relationship between client and developer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Notice that absence of the client in the design, building, and validation</li>
</ul>
<p>This is partly the result of mitigating the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>mission creep</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>introduced by the client&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Iron Triangle</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Spiral Method</strong></p>
<p>The Spiral Method recognizes the need to be more iterative, and introduces the client at points in an<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>ongoing cycle</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Presumably, clients are involved in objective identification and testing ...</li>
</ul>

<p>The methods have the virtue of being<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>rational</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>comprehensive</strong>, defining all the things involved in software development</p>
<ul>
<li>But they are<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>very linear</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Even the Spiral method, which is really a 2D linear process, where phases are features and iterations are observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary sequence <strong><code>S = OI &rarr; AE &rarr; PD &rarr; NPP</code></strong></li>
<li>Process<strong><code>P = S<sub>1</sub><span>&nbsp;</span>&rarr; S<sub>2</sub><span>&nbsp;</span>&rarr; S<sub>3</sub><span>&nbsp;</span>&rarr; ... &rarr; S<sub>N</sub></code></strong></li>
</ul>
