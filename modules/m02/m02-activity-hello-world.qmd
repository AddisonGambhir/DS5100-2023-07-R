# Activity: Hello, World!

## The Python Interactive Shell

Log onto the Rivanna shell and move into in the course directory you created for this class. 

From the command line, enter python 

You should get the Python Shell:

This is also called the Python standard REPL, which stands for "Read-Eval-Print Loop".

Make sure you see that you are using version 3 of Python.

If you see Python 2, exit the shell by entering `quit()` and try again by entering python3 at the command line.

At the `>>>` prompt type `print("Hello, World!")` and press return.

If you've never used Python, you've just completed an important ritual. If you have used Python, well, you did it again :-) 

To exit the Python Shell, enter `quit()`  or `exit()` and hit return.

## Python Files

Now create a file called `hello.py` using the command line editor `nano`.

Then run it from the command line by directly invoking the Python interpreter python.
