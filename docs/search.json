Each student has an account on Rivanna and access to resources there based on participation in this course. We will use Rivanna in our class for both Python and R. \nThis page describes some of the tools available for your use in this course. For information about Rivanna, see this introduction. Resources for getting help, including a knowledge base and ticket system, are found at the Support Option’s Page on UVA’s Research Computing website.\nYou may need to use VPN to access Rivanna from an off-grounds location. To install VPN on your computer, go to the ITS VPN page for instructions. Note that you should connect to “UVA Anywhere,” not to any of the higher security options. Course Allocation\nThis course has been allocated compute and space resources on Rivanna. The names of the resources are given below. The allocation ID needs to be entered to access certain tools. The storage path is accessible to you on the remote server.\n\nAllocation ID: msds_ds5100\nStorage path: /project/MSDS_DS5100  (Don’t use unless directed to.)"

Below are some brief descriptions of the tools.\nFile Explorer. A web-based GUI to access the file system of the remote server. Can be used to create, move, and delete directories and files, and to edit the contents of files (see Editor). You can also upload and download files through this interface. The File Explorer is useful to view your remote content and manage files and directories without having to use the command line. Note that not all operations can be performed through this interface.\nFind under “Files” in the menu. \nEditor. A web-based text editor launched from the File Explorer to view and edit text files on the remote server.  Although not as sophisticated as VS Code (below), this is very useful for editing data and code files without having to use a command line editor. One advantage over VS Code is that it does not need to be launched – which means it does not time out like the Interactive Apps listed below.\nThe Editor is launched from the File Explorer.\nSSH Shell Access (Terminal). Access to the command line of the remote server.  Use this to open a terminal window to perform Linux commands directly.  Note that It is necessary to use a terminal to install and run certain programs on the remote server.\nFind under “Clusters” in the menu. \nYou can also access the remote command line via SSH on your local computer. Just enter the following on the command line of either a PC or Mac:\nssh -Y <userid>@hpc.rivanna.virginia.edu\nReplace <userid> with your UVA Net ID, e.g. abc2x. \nBe suer to be running VPN if you are accessing Rivanna from an off-grounds location."

Be sure to give yourself enough time when launching these, and to be aware of how much time you have when working.\nNote also that you should allocate the fewest resources necessary to do the work you plan to do. This saves resources on the remote host, but also allows your app to launch more quickly. If you ask for an excessive amount of resources, you may wait a long time (e.g. hours) to have your app launched.\nDesktop. Access to a GUI desktop to the remote server. This provides a access to various applications on the server, including a web browser, a file explorer, and terminal windows.  Using this is not necessary if you can get by with the tools listed above.\nFind under “Interactive Apps > Desktop” in the menu.\nVS Code. Access to Visual Studio Code on the remote server.

They also, typically provide GUIs but we won’t go into those here.\nThe Unix family includes all varieties of Linux and the Mac OS (which is based on FreeBSD).\nThe command line that you actually interact with – the set of commands available to you – is called a shell, and there are several shells that you can run on your system. The most typical shell in use today is called bash which stands for Bourne Again Shell, since it is an improved version of bsh (The Bourne Shell). New versions of MacOS use the Z shell (zsh). The commands in these two shells are mostly similar, but there are subtle differences.\nWindows has shells too for its command line interface. The default shell is DOS, but is also has PowerShell  as an advanced (and very capable) option.\nFor more information, check out these resources:\n\nUVA Research Computing’s Unix tutorial.\nNewham, 2005, Learning the bash Shell, O’Reilly Media.\nJeroen Janssens, 2021, Data Science From the Command Line, O’Reilly Media.\nNeal Stephenson, 1999, In the Beginning Was The Command Line.

I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his [sic] code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.\n\nWhich sounds a lot like Eric Raymond’s “Rule of Representation” from 2003:\n\nFold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust.\n\nWhich was just his summary of ideas like this one from Rob Pike in 1989:\n\nData dominates. If you’ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.\n\nWhich cites Fred Brooks from 1975:\n\nRepresentation is the Essence of Programming\n\nBeyond craftsmanship lies invention, and it is here that lean, spare, fast programs are born. Almost always these are the result of strategic breakthrough rather than tactical cleverness. Sometimes the strategic breakthrough will be a new algorithm, such as the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform or the substitution of an n log n sort for an n 2 set of comparisons.\n\n\nMuch more often, strategic breakthrough will come from redoing the representation of the data or tables. This is where the heart of your program lies. Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall be continued to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts; they’ll be obvious."

It should contain upper case letters, lower case letters, digits, and preferably at least one punctuation character.\n\nAdd the key to ssh-agent.\n\nEnter: eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nEnter: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n\nIf you’re using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify your ~/.ssh/config file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain. Follow the instructions here (at step 2).\n\n\n5.2.2 Part B\nOn your GitHub account\nGet the public key that was just generated.\n\nEnter: more ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\nCopy the result to your clipboard (e.g. by blocking off the line and entering Ctrl-C).\nThe key should begin ssh-ed25519 and end with the email address you used in generating the key. In between it will have a long string of alphanumeric characters.\n\nOn GitHub, go to your account settings and select “SSH and GPG Keys” from the side menu.\n\nA link to your account settings can be found in the drop-down list produced by clicking on your user icon in the upper right of the website.\n\nUnder “SSH keys,” press the “New SSH Key” button.\n\nAdd a brief title describing the context of the key, i.e. the local machine where it was generated, e.g. Rivanna.\nChoose “Authentication Key” as the Key type.\nPaste the key into the Key text area.\nSubmit the form by pressing “Add SSH key.”\n\nYou are now good to go.

This is accompanied by a brief, descriptive message of the changes made.\ngit commit -m \"What you did\"\n\n\nPush\nPushing the changes to the remote repo that you cloned from.
